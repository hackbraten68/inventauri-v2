# Feature Specification: Login Page Dark Mode

**Feature Branch**: `002-login-page-dark`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "login page dark mode i want the login site also in dark mode and a theme toggle located around the login card."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users accessing the login page can switch between light and dark themes to improve visual comfort and accessibility, with their theme preference being easily accessible near the login card.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the login page in light mode, **When** they click the theme toggle, **Then** the login page switches to dark mode with appropriate contrast and colors
2. **Given** a user visits the login page in dark mode, **When** they click the theme toggle, **Then** the login page switches to light mode with appropriate contrast and colors
3. **Given** a user has set their theme preference, **When** they return to the login page, **Then** their preferred theme is maintained

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has system-level dark mode preferences set?
- How does the theme toggle behave on mobile devices with limited screen space?
- What happens if the theme toggle is clicked during the login process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a theme toggle control positioned near the login card
- **FR-002**: System MUST support switching between light and dark themes on the login page
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain user's theme preference across page visits
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all text and interface elements maintain proper contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure the theme toggle is accessible and usable via keyboard navigation
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the theme toggle remains visible and functional during all states of the login process

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Theme Preference**: Represents a user's choice between light and dark themes, associated with their authentication session or browser storage

## Clarifications *(added 2025-09-25)*

### Session 1: Theme Persistence Strategy
**Question**: How should user theme preferences be stored?  
**Answer**: No persistence (reset each visit)  
**Rationale**: Users should be able to reset their theme preference on each visit for maximum flexibility.

### Session 2: System Theme Detection
**Question**: Should the login page automatically detect the user's system dark mode preference?  
**Answer**: Yes, use system preference as default  
**Rationale**: Provides better user experience by respecting user's system-level accessibility preferences.

### Session 3: Mobile Responsiveness
**Question**: How should the theme toggle be positioned on mobile devices?  
**Answer**: Bottom of login card  
**Rationale**: Maintains easy access while keeping the interface clean and avoiding screen real estate conflicts.

### Session 4: Accessibility Requirements
**Question**: What contrast ratio should be maintained for text in dark mode?  
**Answer**: 4.5:1 (WCAG AA standard)  
**Rationale**: Ensures compliance with standard accessibility guidelines for text readability.

### Session 5: Login Process Behavior
**Question**: What should happen if user clicks theme toggle during login?  
**Answer**: Show confirmation dialog  
**Rationale**: Prevents accidental theme changes during critical authentication process.
