# Phase 0 Research: Login Page Dark Mode

## Research Findings & Decisions

### 1. Theme Implementation Approach
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS dark mode with class strategy
**Rationale**: Astro + Tailwind CSS stack uses class-based dark mode for optimal performance and consistency with existing codebase
**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS custom properties (variables) - More flexible but requires more setup
- JavaScript state management - Overkill for simple theme switching
- CSS-in-JS solutions - Not aligned with Tailwind approach

### 2. Theme Detection Strategy
**Decision**: Use `prefers-color-scheme` media query with fallback to light mode
**Rationale**: Provides automatic system preference detection as specified in clarifications
**Alternatives considered**:
- Always default to light mode - Ignores user accessibility preferences
- Always default to dark mode - Poor UX for light mode users
- User preference storage - Not needed per clarification (no persistence)

### 3. Theme Toggle Component
**Decision**: Create reusable ThemeToggle component with sun/moon icons
**Rationale**: Consistent with modern web app patterns and existing design system
**Alternatives considered**:
- Text-based toggle - Less intuitive for users
- Dropdown selector - Takes more space
- Hidden in settings - Less discoverable

### 4. Accessibility Compliance
**Decision**: Target WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast ratio)
**Rationale**: Meets clarification requirements and standard accessibility guidelines
**Alternatives considered**:
- WCAG AAA (7:1) - Too restrictive for design flexibility
- WCAG A (3:1) - Insufficient for accessibility compliance
- No specific ratio - Doesn't meet requirements

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
**Decision**: Position toggle at bottom of login card on mobile
**Rationale**: Maintains accessibility while optimizing for thumb-friendly interaction
**Alternatives considered**:
- Top-right corner - May be hard to reach on large screens
- Floating action button - Could interfere with login flow
- Hidden in hamburger menu - Less discoverable

### 6. Login Process Integration
**Decision**: Show confirmation dialog when theme toggle clicked during login
**Rationale**: Prevents accidental interruption of authentication process
**Alternatives considered**:
- Immediate theme switch - Could confuse users during login
- Queue theme change - More complex implementation
- Ignore toggle - Poor user experience

### 7. Performance Considerations
**Decision**: Theme switching should complete in <100ms
**Rationale**: Ensures smooth user experience without blocking interactions
**Alternatives considered**:
- No performance target - Could lead to poor UX
- Slower target (250ms) - Unnecessarily slow for simple operation
- Complex animations - Could impact performance

### 8. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Unit tests for theme logic, integration tests for user flows
**Rationale**: Aligns with constitutional requirements for comprehensive testing
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only - Insufficient for CI/CD pipeline
- Visual regression tests - Overkill for theme switching
- End-to-end tests only - Misses unit-level coverage

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   └── ThemeToggle.tsx     # Reusable theme toggle component
│   └── auth/
│       └── LoginForm.tsx       # Updated to support dark mode
├── lib/
│   └── theme.ts               # Theme utilities and state management
└── layouts/
    └── AppLayout.astro        # Root layout with theme provider
```

### State Management
- Theme preference stored in browser (no persistence per clarification)
- System theme detection via `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Theme context provider for component access

### CSS Strategy
- Tailwind CSS dark mode classes (`dark:` prefixes)
- Consistent color tokens across light and dark themes
- Smooth transitions for theme switching

## Dependencies & Integration Points

### Existing Dependencies to Leverage
- Tailwind CSS - For dark mode utilities and responsive design
- TypeScript - For type safety
- Vitest - For testing framework
- Astro - For component framework

### New Dependencies Needed
- None identified - can be implemented with existing stack

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Theme toggle component implementation
- CSS dark mode classes
- Basic theme switching logic

### Medium Risk
- Mobile responsiveness optimization
- Accessibility compliance validation
- Integration with existing login flow

### High Risk
- None identified - feature is well-contained

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Generate data model for theme preferences
- Create API contracts for theme operations
- Develop quickstart validation scenarios
