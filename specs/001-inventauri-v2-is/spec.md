   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a micro-shop owner, I want to manage my inventory efficiently so that I can keep track of my products, monitor stock levels, and understand sales performance without complex enterprise software.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a shop owner, **When** I add a new item to inventory, **Then** I should see it in my product list with initial stock level
2. **Given** I have items in my inventory, **When** I make a sale, **Then** the stock levels should automatically update
3. **Given** I want to check my inventory, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I should see current stock levels and low stock alerts
4. **Given** I need to analyze sales, **When** I view the reports section, **Then** I should see sales trends and top-selling items

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stock reaches zero?
- How does the system handle negative inventory scenarios?
- What happens if multiple users try to update the same item simultaneously?
- How does the system handle product variants (e.g., different sizes, colors)?

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow adding, editing, and archiving products with details (name, SKU, description, price, cost, barcode, category)
- **FR-002**: System MUST track current stock levels for each product variant
- **FR-003**: System MUST record sales transactions with date, items, quantities, and total amount
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide low stock alerts when inventory falls below defined thresholds
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate basic sales reports (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple units of measurement (e.g., pieces, kg, liters)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow inventory adjustments (add/remove stock) with reason tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a searchable product catalog
- **FR-009**: System MUST support basic user authentication and authorization
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain an audit log of all inventory changes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System SHOULD be accessible via web browser on desktop and mobile devices
- **NFR-002**: System SHOULD have a responsive design for various screen sizes
- **NFR-003**: System SHOULD support offline functionality with data sync when online
- **NFR-004**: System SHOULD have a simple, intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- **NFR-005**: System SHOULD be performant with up to 10,000 products

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Product**: Represents an item in inventory (ID, name, SKU, description, price, cost, barcode, category, unit of measure, reorder level)
- **Inventory**: Represents stock levels (product ID, current quantity, location, last updated)
- **Transaction**: Records sales and inventory adjustments (ID, type [sale/adjustment], date, user, items, total, notes)
- **Category**: Groups products (ID, name, description)
- **User**: System users with different permission levels (ID, name, email, role, last login)

## Clarifications
### Session 1 (2025-09-24)
1) Tenancy model
- Question: What is the deployment/tenancy model to target first?
- Answer: B) Multi-tenant ‚Äî multiple shops in one instance, isolated by account
- Implications: Data model requires a Shop/Account entity with tenancy scoping for Products, Inventory, Transactions, Users. Access control and reporting must be scoped by shop. Migration path should still allow single-tenant self-hosted instances that run with a single Shop record.
2) Roles and authentication
- Question: What roles and authentication approach should we support initially?
- Answer: B) Roles: Owner, Manager, Staff. Auth: Email/password
- Implications: Role-based authorization policies needed for Owner/Manager/Staff. Manager can perform most operations except tenant‚Äëwide/admin settings reserved for Owner. Email/password flows must include password reset and minimal session management; magic links or SSO can be deferred.
3) Product variants and units
- Question: How should product variants and units be modeled?
- Answer: A) Variants as distinct SKUs under a parent product (size/color), fixed unit per variant
- Implications: Data model includes `Product` (parent) and `ProductVariant` with unique SKU per variant. Inventory, pricing, and stock thresholds tracked at variant level. Unit of measure defined per variant and immutable once transactions exist.
4) Offline capability and sales
- Question: Offline sales and conflict resolution?
- Answer: B) Offline read-only; sales require online connection
- Implications: UI must gracefully degrade when offline (catalog/browse, stock view allowed). Prevent checkout when offline with clear messaging. No conflict resolution logic required for sales; reduce scope for v1 while keeping path for future offline sync.
5) Reporting scope (v1)
- Question: Reporting scope for v1?
- Answer: A) Basic sales totals and trends (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Implications: Implement foundational reporting: time-bucketed sales totals and trend lines. Defer top sellers/low‚Äëstock, returns/discounts, tax breakdown, and staff/customer analytics to future iterations.

## Open Questions
1. What is the expected number of concurrent users?
2. Are there specific reporting requirements beyond basic sales data?
3. Is barcode scanning support required?
4. Are there any specific tax calculation requirements?
5. What are the data backup and recovery requirements?

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine requirements with stakeholders
2. Create wireframes for key interfaces
3. Develop technical architecture
4. Create detailed test cases
5. Begin implementation planning
