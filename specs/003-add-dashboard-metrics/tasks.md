# Tasks: Dashboard Operational Metrics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-add-dashboard-metrics/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Required for this feature ‚Äî spec mandates unit or integration coverage for each new metric.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Ensure local environment and data prerequisites match quickstart guidance.

- [x] T001 Install dependencies and regenerate Prisma client via scripts in package.json
- [x] T002 Seed sample stock and inbound data for dashboard metrics using prisma/seed.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Shared utilities and typings required by all user stories.

- [x] T003 Create shared metrics helper module for sales, velocity, and inbound summaries in src/lib/data/dashboard-metrics.ts
- [x] T004 Extend DashboardSnapshot typings to reference new helper outputs in src/lib/data/dashboard.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready ‚Äî user story implementation can now begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Compare Sales Momentum (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Display sales deltas versus the preceding period aligned with the active totals metric.

**Independent Test**: Load `/dashboard` for multiple ranges and confirm totals include absolute/percent delta with directional indicator or fallback when prior data is absent.

### Tests for User Story 1

- [ ] T005 [US1] Add unit coverage for sales delta calculations in tests/unit/dashboard-sales-delta.spec.ts
- [ ] T006 [US1] Extend dashboard API contract assertions for totals.salesDelta in tests/contracts/dashboard.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T007 [US1] Implement prior-range aggregation and delta calculation in src/lib/data/dashboard-metrics.ts
- [ ] T008 [US1] Populate totals.salesDelta and direction state in getDashboardSnapshot within src/lib/data/dashboard.ts
- [ ] T009 [US1] Render sales delta badge with fallback messaging in totals card in src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is independently functional and testable.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Gauge Low-Stock Longevity (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Surface days of cover for low-stock warnings based on recent sales velocity.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a low-stock warning and verify days-of-cover or ‚ÄúInsufficient data‚Äù displays alongside thresholds with correct rounding.

### Tests for User Story 2

- [ ] T010 [US2] Add unit coverage for sales velocity and days-of-cover helpers in tests/unit/dashboard-days-cover.spec.ts
- [ ] T011 [US2] Extend dashboard contract test to expect warnings[].daysOfCover fields in tests/contracts/dashboard.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T012 [US2] Implement rolling velocity + days-of-cover helper logic in src/lib/data/dashboard-metrics.ts
- [ ] T013 [US2] Populate warnings entries with daysOfCover and status tags in src/lib/data/dashboard.ts
- [ ] T014 [US2] Display days-of-cover values and insufficient-data notice in warning list UI within src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 and 2 both operate independently.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Verify Purchase Order Alignment (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Show inbound coverage (quantities and arrival dates) next to each low-stock warning.

**Independent Test**: For a warning with inbound stock, confirm inbound units and earliest arrival display; for none, confirm omission without layout breakage.

### Tests for User Story 3

- [ ] T015 [US3] Add unit coverage for inbound coverage summariser in tests/unit/dashboard-inbound-coverage.spec.ts
- [ ] T016 [US3] Extend dashboard contract test to validate warnings[].inboundCoverage in tests/contracts/dashboard.test.ts

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T017 [US3] Summarise inbound stockTransactions by SKU and range in src/lib/data/dashboard-metrics.ts
- [ ] T018 [US3] Attach inboundCoverage details to warnings payload in src/lib/data/dashboard.ts
- [ ] T019 [US3] Present inbound quantity and arrival info in warning cards within src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx

**Checkpoint**: All user stories function independently and satisfy acceptance scenarios.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T020 Document validation steps for new dashboard metrics in specs/003-add-dashboard-metrics/quickstart.md
- [ ] T021 Summarise dashboard metrics release notes in ROADMAP.md

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase Dependencies**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí User Stories (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3) ‚Üí Polish.
- **Story Dependencies**: US2 and US3 depend on foundational helpers and may reuse US1 utilities but must remain independently shippable.
- **Within Stories**: Write tests (T005/T006, T010/T011, T015/T016) before corresponding implementation tasks to honour the testing approach decision.

---

## Parallel Opportunities

- After Phase 2, different developers can tackle US1, US2, and US3 concurrently once shared helpers stabilise.
- Within each story, UI updates (T009, T014, T019) can follow completion of data-layer tasks but may proceed in parallel with documentation tasks once API shape stabilises.
- Polish tasks (T020, T021) can run in parallel with final verification once all stories land.

---

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP First**: Complete Phases 1‚Äì3 to deliver sales trend deltas as the initial release slice.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Ship US2 once velocity calculations stabilise, then US3 for inbound visibility; each phase adds value without blocking prior releases.
- **Validation**: After each story, run relevant unit and contract tests plus manual dashboard checks per quickstart guidance before progressing.
