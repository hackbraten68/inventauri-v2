# Feature Specification: Language Support (Internationalization)

**Feature Branch**: `003-feat-language-support`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "feat language support. i want this entire app i18n friendly. users selected language should be detected and redirect accordingly with the proper language set. for now english (as default) and german. should be easy extendable for more languages. on login screen besides light/dark toggle little icon with the flag. on click small modal should open with all available languages. when user is logged in, language switch should be also placed next to the theme toggler with same modal but a bit more detailed. keep responsivness and easy to use on mobile key here, also accessability."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to use the application in my preferred language so that I can navigate and understand the interface comfortably in either English or German, with the option to easily switch between languages using intuitive UI controls that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application, **When** they have a browser language set to German, **Then** the application automatically detects this and displays German content
2. **Given** a user is on the login screen, **When** they click the language flag icon next to the theme toggle, **Then** a modal opens showing available language options
3. **Given** a user is logged into the application, **When** they click the language switcher next to the theme toggler, **Then** a detailed modal opens allowing language selection
4. **Given** a user selects a different language from the modal, **When** they confirm the selection, **Then** the entire application interface updates to the selected language
5. **Given** a user is using the application on a mobile device, **When** they interact with language controls, **Then** the interface remains responsive and easy to use

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's browser language is not supported?
- How does the system handle missing translations for specific text strings?
- What occurs when a user switches languages while on a specific page?
- How should the system behave for users with accessibility needs (screen readers, keyboard navigation)?
