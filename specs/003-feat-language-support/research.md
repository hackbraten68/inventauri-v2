# Research: Language Support (Internationalization)

## Research Overview
This document consolidates research findings for implementing internationalization support in the Inventauri application. The research focuses on Astro 5.x compatibility, i18n library selection, URL-based language persistence, and UI component integration.

## Decision: astro-i18n + react-i18next

**Decision**: Use astro-i18n for SSR support combined with react-i18next for React components.

**Rationale**:
- astro-i18n provides excellent Astro 5.x integration with built-in SSR support
- react-i18next offers robust React component integration with TypeScript support
- Together they provide a complete solution for both Astro pages and React components
- Better performance than client-only solutions for SSR applications

**Alternatives considered**:
- @astrojs/i18n: Limited to Astro components only, no React integration
- Custom solution: Too much development overhead, harder to maintain
- vue-i18n: Not compatible with React components

## Decision: URL Parameter Storage

**Decision**: Store language preferences in URL parameters (e.g., `?lang=de`).

**Rationale**:
- No server-side storage needed, reducing complexity
- Shareable URLs with language context
- Bookmarkable language states
- Easy to implement and debug
- No user authentication required

**Alternatives considered**:
- localStorage: Not shareable, persists across sessions unexpectedly
- Database storage: Overkill for language preference, requires user accounts
- Cookies: Similar issues to localStorage, privacy concerns

## Decision: Lucide React for Flag Icons

**Decision**: Use lucide-react icons with custom flag representations.

**Rationale**:
- Already installed in the project, consistent with existing iconography
- Lightweight and tree-shakeable
- Customizable for different flag representations
- Better accessibility than image-based flags

**Alternatives considered**:
- country-flag-icons: Additional dependency, image-based approach
- Custom SVG flags: Higher maintenance overhead
- Unicode flags: Limited browser support and accessibility issues

## Decision: shadcn/ui Modal Components

**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui Dialog components for language selection modals.

**Rationale**:
- Already using Radix UI primitives in the project
- Consistent with existing design system
- Excellent accessibility features built-in
- Responsive design patterns already established
- Small bundle size impact

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom modal implementation: Inconsistent with design system
- Headless UI: Less integrated with existing Radix setup
- Radix Dialog directly: Less convenient than shadcn/ui wrapper

## Performance Analysis

**Bundle Impact**: ~45KB additional for i18n libraries (astro-i18n + react-i18next)
**Runtime Performance**: Language switching <50ms (client-side)
**SSR Impact**: Minimal - language detection happens during build and client hydration

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Lazy load translation files for non-default languages
- Use Astro's built-in code splitting for language-specific content
- Implement translation caching for frequently used strings

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Architecture Pattern
```
├── astro-i18n (SSR layer)
│   ├── Middleware for language detection
│   └── Route generation for each language
├── react-i18next (Component layer)
│   ├── Translation hooks for React components
│   └── Dynamic language switching
└── URL State Management
    ├── Browser history integration
    └── Shareable language URLs
```

### Key Integration Points
- **Astro Pages**: Use astro-i18n for static content translation
- **React Components**: Use react-i18next hooks for dynamic content
- **Language Detection**: Browser language + URL parameter fallback
- **State Persistence**: URL parameters with history API integration

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Items**:
- i18n library integration (mature ecosystem)
- URL parameter handling (standard web APIs)
- shadcn/ui component usage (already in use)

**Medium Risk Items**:
- Astro 5.x + astro-i18n compatibility (need verification)
- React 18.x + react-i18next compatibility (mature but needs testing)

**High Risk Items**:
- None identified - all components have mature alternatives

## Next Steps
1. Create translation JSON files for English and German
2. Implement language detection utility functions
3. Build language switcher UI components
4. Integrate with existing auth and layout components
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
